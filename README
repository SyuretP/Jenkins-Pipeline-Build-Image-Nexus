Jenkins Pipeline
- Building an image from Dockerfile
- pushes image to private Nexus repo
- another remote server is pulling the lastest version of the image and runs it as a docker container
- docker deletes the container based on the image it runs from, then it pulls the latest version of the image and runs a new container from it.
